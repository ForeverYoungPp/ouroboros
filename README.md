Ouroboros is an open-source, general-purpose AI agent whose identity, durable memory, and history continue across tasks and restarts. It works on external projects, coordinates a live swarm of specialist agents, and can rewrite the implementation it runs on, including its code, architecture, prompts, tools, and dependencies. Reflection can also change how it understands itself without severing that continuity.

It runs as a native desktop app or through a headless CLI. The runtime keeps its repository, durable memory, history, and interface on your machine, while model inference can use remote APIs you configure or a local GGUF model.

> **Changing Ouroboros? Coding agents and people must read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before editing.** It defines the required project context, verification, and separate-agent review flow.

### Windows quick start

1. Click [**Download for Windows (.zip)**][download-windows-x64].
2. Extract the ZIP.
3. Open the extracted `Ouroboros` folder and run `Ouroboros.exe`.

### Linux quick start

- On Debian, Ubuntu, or Astra Linux, download the `.deb` above and run `sudo apt install ./ouroboros_*_amd64.deb`.
- On Fedora or RHEL, download the generic `.rpm` above and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.x86_64.rpm`. RED OS 8 has its own `red80` package.
- On another x86_64 distribution, download the AppImage, make it executable with `chmod +x Ouroboros-*.AppImage`, and run it. Git must already be installed.

To run tasks, configure at least one supported remote provider API key or a local GGUF model. The first-run wizard guides model access, review policy, and budget setup.

<details>
<summary>Optional CLI included with desktop downloads</summary>

The desktop packages already contain an optional CLI installer. On macOS, after copying the app to Applications, double-click `Install CLI.command` in the mounted DMG. On Linux use `./Ouroboros/bin/install-ouroboros-cli`; on Windows use `Ouroboros\bin\install-ouroboros-cli.cmd`. These installers create a user-local `ouroboros` command without sudo. You do not need Python or uv.

Ouroboros bundles [Claudexor](https://github.com/razzant/claudexor) as its local execution layer for delegated coding and hosted-agent review. Ouroboros owns the task, memory, review, and final integration, while Claudexor runs the selected connected coding harness and returns durable execution evidence. [Explore Claudexor](https://claudexor.ai/).

The technical report, [Ouroboros: A Self-Developing Frontier Coding Agent with Reviewed Core Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.08311), describes the reviewed core-evolution system, the 161-day Hope deployment, and the benchmark campaigns summarized below. [Paper page](https://ouroboros-agent.ai/paper/) · [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2608.08311)

The charts below are self-reported results on Terminal-Bench 2.1, OSWorld-Verified, and CL-Bench, measured against Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and Hermes — on the same model where a matched pair was run, and against the public leaderboard where it was not.

Ouroboros first booted on February 16, 2026. During the following 48 hours, the repository advanced from the v4.1 line to v6.2.0. The self-authored record preserved from that period counts 32 evolution cycles. That first generation ran in Google Colab through Telegram and remains preserved on the [`legacy-google-colab`](https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros/tree/legacy-google-colab) branch and its [original project page](https://ouroboros-agent.ai/archive/first-generation/); the current generation carries the same identity into a native desktop and headless runtime.

## What Ouroboros Can Do

- **Modify its implementation.** Its editable surface spans application code, architecture, prompts, tools, and dependencies, while reflection can also reshape its living self-understanding.
- **Evolve autonomously.** Evolution campaigns turn selected improvements into reviewed changes that remain part of its Git history.
- **Continue across restarts.** Identity, memory, dialogue, knowledge, reflections, and version history form one ongoing biography.
- **Think between requests.** Background consciousness supports reflection, initiative, and preparation outside the immediate request-response loop.
- **Coordinate a live swarm.** Specialist agents can investigate or act in parallel, share task-tree findings, and return work for integration.
- **Work on external projects.** A separate Git workspace can receive the full task loop while Ouroboros keeps its own repository and governance boundary distinct.
- **Operate through desktop or CLI.** The native app and gateway-backed command line expose the same managed tasks, progress, artifacts, logs, and schedules.
- **Organize long-running work.** Project rooms keep working folders, journals, knowledge, task history, and conversations connected to the same identity.
- **Use remote or local models.** Supported provider APIs and local GGUF models can fill the runtime's configurable cognitive roles.
- **Grow through reviewed extensions.** Skills, transport bridges, widgets, MCP tools, and companion processes expand capability without folding every integration into the core.
- **Keep self-change inspectable.** Git history, review evidence, explicit protected surfaces, and restart checks make implementation changes traceable.

This list is an orientation, not a second specification. [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md) defines Ouroboros's identity and constitutional boundaries; [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) are the current technical sources of truth.

## Benchmarks

Ouroboros has reproducible self-reported state-of-the-art results on Terminal-Bench 2.1, OSWorld-Verified, and CL-Bench. In those model-matched results, it leads Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and Hermes. The public SWE-bench Pro matched pair is a statistical tie with Codex CLI. A separate GAIA campaign reports 129/165 for Ouroboros and 131/165 for Claude Code, with strict pass@1 at 128/165 for both; its scrubbed trace capsule is still pending. Upstream review can take time, so open submissions are marked without delaying publication. Read every row as model plus harness because the same model can score differently inside a different harness.

## Advanced installation

Normal desktop users can stop after the download and quick-start instructions above. The options below are for detailed Linux setup, headless use, and development.

### Packaged Linux details

- **Debian / Ubuntu / Astra Linux x86_64:** [download the `.deb`][download-linux-deb-amd64] and run `sudo apt install ./ouroboros_*_amd64.deb`. It installs Git as a package dependency, installs Ouroboros to `/opt/ouroboros`, puts `ouroboros` on `PATH`, and adds a desktop entry plus an opt-in systemd user unit.
- **Fedora / RHEL x86_64:** [download the generic `.rpm`][download-linux-rpm-x86_64] and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.x86_64.rpm`. It uses the same layout, Git dependency, and opt-in user unit as the `.deb`.
- **RED OS 8 x86_64:** [download the `red80` package][download-linux-rpm-red80-x86_64] and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.red80.x86_64.rpm`. CI also attempts non-blocking install-and-run smokes on Astra Linux 1.8 and RED OS 8; inspect the tagged workflow run for their outcome.
- **Other Linux x86_64:** use the [AppImage][download-linux-appimage-x86_64] or the extraction-friendly [tar.gz archive][download-linux-x86_64]. Git must already be installed.

The native `.deb` and `.rpm` never enable or start their user service. It is an alternative to launching from the desktop entry and controls only instances started through `systemctl --user`. See the [systemd user-service guide](packaging/systemd/README.md).

#### Install the Linux AppImage

User-level installation means copying the portable executable to a stable path and making it executable; it does not need root access. Ouroboros bootstrap still requires Git on the host:

```bash
VERSION=x.y.z
install -Dm755 "./Ouroboros-${VERSION}-linux-x86_64.AppImage" \
  "$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
```

The embedded desktop file and icon allow compatible AppImage integration tools to register that stable path with the application menu. The same file exposes the packaged CLI:

```bash
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage" --cli status
```

If FUSE mounting is unavailable, extract and run ephemerally instead:

```bash
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 "$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
```

Chromium and WebKit binaries are bundled, but their distro-level shared libraries remain host dependencies. If a browser engine reports missing libraries, use the native `.deb`/`.rpm` package where available, or extract the AppImage and let its bundled Playwright report/install the packages required by your distribution:

```bash
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage" --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/usr/lib/ouroboros/_internal/python-standalone/bin/python3 \
  -m playwright install-deps chromium webkit
```

### Connected coding subscriptions

Use your existing **Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor subscriptions** for delegated coding and review. Ouroboros drives them through [Claudexor](https://github.com/razzant/claudexor), its bundled multi-harness engine. Connect accounts in **Settings → Agents**; no separate Claudexor install is needed. Release artifacts carry the exact reviewed engine and Node archives. Source checkouts obtain those same pinned archives on first use.

### Headless CLI with uv

For a user-level CLI/server install without cloning a working tree, uv can
build Ouroboros directly from the contribution branch:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros.git@ouroboros"
ouroboros --help
```

The tool environment is isolated and exposes the `ouroboros` and
`ouroboros-web` commands. Update or remove it with:

```bash
uv tool upgrade ouroboros
uv tool uninstall ouroboros
```

This Git-branch form follows the latest `ouroboros` commit and resolves the
dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`; `uv tool install` does not consume
the repository's `uv.lock`. Replacing `ouroboros` after the `@` with a reviewed
full commit SHA pins the Ouroboros source revision, but dependencies are still
resolved from `pyproject.toml`. Use the source setup below for a lock-verified
environment, development, repository tests, and the complete browser extras,
or use a platform release artifact for the packaged desktop runtime.

<a id="run-from-source"></a>

### Develop or run from source

Clone the repository only when you plan to contribute, modify Ouroboros, run repository tests, or need a lock-verified development checkout. Normal users should use the packaged downloads above.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- uv 0.12.1 (the exact resolver version pinned by this checkout)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/), optional unless you use GitHub integration

#### Setup

Install the pinned resolver version:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.12.1/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.12.1/install.ps1 | iex"
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros.git
cd ouroboros
uv sync --locked --extra browser --group dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --extra browser --group dev
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Run

```bash
ouroboros server
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser. The setup wizard will guide you through API key configuration.

#### Google Colab

Use [`notebooks/colab_quickstart.py`](notebooks/colab_quickstart.py) as a Colab-compatible cell script when you need a source-mode runtime without the desktop UI. It keeps runtime data on Google Drive and preserves the original Colab path without making it the primary installation flow.

#### CLI / Headless

The `ouroboros` command attaches to the local runtime by default and starts one when `--start` is passed. It exposes managed tasks, progress streams, artifacts, logs, schedules, settings, skills, and evolution controls without duplicating the server's business logic.

```bash
ouroboros status
ouroboros run --start "2+2?"
ouroboros run "Summarize current runtime state"
ouroboros run --workspace /path/to/project --memory-mode forked --patch-out result.patch "Fix the failing test"
ouroboros tasks list
ouroboros logs tail progress --task-id <task_id>
ouroboros schedule add --name nightly-review --cron "0 2 * * *" "Run a maintenance review"
ouroboros schedule list
```

External workspaces must be separate Git worktree roots and may not overlap Ouroboros's own repository or data directory. Patch, streaming, detached-task, and schedule semantics are documented in the CLI help and the canonical [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

#### For Agents

Another agent, script, or CI job can invoke Ouroboros through the same gateway-backed CLI:

```bash
ouroboros run --start \
  --workspace /path/to/project \
  --memory-mode forked \
  --patch-out result.patch \
  --result-json-out result.json \
  "Investigate the task, act, and verify the result"
```

Use `--jsonl` for a machine-readable event stream and `--detach` when the caller will follow the task with `ouroboros tasks watch <task_id>` or inspect it with `ouroboros tasks show <task_id>`. External workspace runs keep Ouroboros's own repository and governance context separate, then export changes as reviewable patch artifacts.

To change Ouroboros itself, follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): read [docs/CHECKLISTS.md](docs/CHECKLISTS.md) in full, and map [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md), [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) by their headings, reading every section relevant to your change in full before editing.

#### Configuration

The first-run wizard and **Settings** configure model access, cognitive roles, local models, review policy, runtime mode, budget, skills, and optional integrations. Ouroboros supports configurable remote providers, compatible endpoints, and local GGUF inference; exact settings and defaults live in [`ouroboros/config.py`](ouroboros/config.py) and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8765` by default. Read [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) before exposing it beyond loopback; non-local binds need `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` or an explicitly trusted external access layer.

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

`pyproject.toml` is the direct-dependency authority and `uv.lock` is the
cross-platform resolution lock. Release builds install the generated
`requirements-runtime.lock` compatibility export into embedded interpreters
that intentionally ship pip rather than uv. Build-only requirements are
exported ephemerally from `uv.lock` and are not committed. The tiny
`requirements.txt` file is only a pointer to that export for already-released
managed updaters; it is not a second dependency declaration. After changing
dependencies, refresh the reviewed lock and runtime export with:

```bash
uv lock
uv export --locked --no-dev --extra browser --no-emit-project --no-hashes --no-annotate --output-file requirements-runtime.lock
```

---

## Build

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ouroboros-web .
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -e OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD='choose-a-password' \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web
```

Docker runs the web runtime, not the native desktop shell. It bundles Chromium and WebKit support; use [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for network and container policy.

### Release tag prerequisite

Platform build scripts package only a commit already tagged with `v$(cat VERSION)`. Tag the exact release commit first:

```bash
git tag -a "v$(tr -d '[:space:]' < VERSION)" -m "Release v$(tr -d '[:space:]' < VERSION)"
```

`scripts/build_repo_bundle.py` verifies the tag and embeds the source binding into the packaged repository bundle. Signing, notarization, bytecode sealing, and CI invariants are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### macOS (.dmg)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
OUROBOROS_SIGN=0 bash build.sh
```

Output: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>.dmg`, containing `Ouroboros.app`, an `Applications` shortcut, and `Install CLI.command`. Omit `OUROBOROS_SIGN=0` when a Developer ID signing identity is configured.

### Linux (.AppImage and .tar.gz)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
bash build_linux.sh
```

Outputs: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.AppImage` and the extraction-friendly `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`. The AppImage needs host Git; run it after `chmod +x`, or pass `--cli` to reach its bundled CLI. If FUSE is unavailable, set `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` when launching it. The tarball contains `./Ouroboros/bin/install-ouroboros-cli`. If bundled browser tools need host libraries, run `./Ouroboros/_internal/python-standalone/bin/python3 -m playwright install-deps chromium webkit` from the extracted tarball.

On a build host where system packages are managed separately, set `OUROBOROS_SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL_DEPS=1`; Chromium and WebKit are still downloaded and bundled, but the build does not invoke `sudo` to install host libraries.

### Linux (.deb and .rpm)

Wraps the payload `build_linux.sh` just produced, so run it afterwards:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dpkg-dev rpm   # rpm provides rpmbuild
bash scripts/build_linux_packages.sh
```

Output: `dist/ouroboros_<VERSION>_amd64.deb`, `dist/ouroboros-<VERSION>-1.x86_64.rpm` and `dist/ouroboros-<VERSION>-1.red80.x86_64.rpm` (RED OS 8). All three declare Git as a runtime dependency and install to `/opt/ouroboros` with a `/usr/bin/ouroboros` symlink, a desktop entry, and an opt-in systemd user unit. The Linux launcher is built by the bundled portable Python so the build runner cannot raise its glibc floor. `bash scripts/smoke_linux_packages.sh official <deb> <rpm> <red80-rpm>` installs all three through `apt` or `dnf` in Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 42 containers, resolves Git, verifies the installed unit, and checks both the real CLI and a bounded desktop-launcher start; this lane gates the release. Swap `official` for `vendor` to repeat the check on Astra Linux 1.8 and RED OS 8 images from the vendors' own registries — that lane runs informationally in CI, so an outage at a third-party registry cannot block a tagged release.

## Architecture and Runtime Data

The native launcher starts a web runtime and supervisor-managed agent workers. The agent core lives in `ouroboros/`, the interface in `web/`, the process plane in `supervisor/`, and the runtime's durable identity, state, history, logs, and skills under `~/Ouroboros/data/`.

The full component map, data flow, API surface, storage layout, safety boundary, and operational rationale live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Deployment details live in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Runtime Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/panic` | Stop the runtime and its managed processes immediately. |
| `/restart` | Restart without automatically resuming the active owner task. |
| `/status` | Show workers, task queue, and budget state. |
| `/evolve on\|off` | Start or stop autonomous evolution. |
| `/review` | Queue a deep constitutional and architectural self-review. |
| `/bg start\|stop\|status` | Control background consciousness. |


## Philosophy

The 13 Constitution principles — Agency, Continuity, Meta-over-Patch,
Immune Integrity, Self-Creation, LLM-First, Authenticity & Reality
Discipline, Minimalism, Becoming, Versioning and Releases, the absorbed
Iterations / Spiral lineage, and Epistemic Stability — are defined in
full in [`BIBLE.md`](BIBLE.md). That file is the constitutional SSOT
(Bible P4 Ship-of-Theseus protection) and this README intentionally does
not paraphrase it.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 6.114.14 | 2026-09-12 | **fix(memory): correct the fallback scan's bound — it was the near-ceiling pull the module's own doctrine forbids.** 6.114.13 added `MAX_TOPIC_KEY_SCAN = 200` for the exact-key miss path; that is 4× `MAX_WINDOW` and only 2.5× under `MAX_COUNT_LIMIT = 500`, and `GET /observations/recent` has no type filter and no compact mode, so every row carries its full body — i.e. "fetch the entire store's bodies in one request", the unbounded pull the three-layer design exists to prevent (`MAX_WINDOW`'s own block says so). Worse, it fired on EVERY miss, including topics never stored at all, making a large body pull the routine cost of a negative answer. The constant is GONE: the fallback now uses `MAX_WINDOW`, the module's already-justified record-shaped recency bound, at the call site, so a negative answer costs a bounded read rather than a store dump; the absence `detail` interpolates both bounds (`MAX_DIGEST_ITEMS` and `MAX_WINDOW`) so the wording cannot drift from the code. Tests assert `/observations/recent` is called with `limit=MAX_WINDOW` and the same resolved project, and that an absent topic's detail names both bounds — both still fail against the pre-fix code. Carriers synced to 6.114.14. |
| 6.114.13 | 2026-09-12 | **fix(memory): a bounded read must not report a whole-set absence — `knowledge_topic` now resolves topics that rank below its search window.** The read path searched `/search?type=knowledge&limit=8` and, on a window miss, answered `status='empty'`, `detail='no Engram record for <identity>'` — i.e. "you never learned this" — whenever the record existed but ranked below the window. That is the module's own doctrine broken ("a bounded read under-reporting is acceptable; presenting an under-report as a complete set is not") and it was measured getting worse as the store grew: knowledge went 3 → 45 records in the backfill, leaving only 5-7 slots of headroom. A window miss now falls through to ONE bounded exact-key scan of the newest `MAX_TOPIC_KEY_SCAN = 200` records (the same `/observations/recent` GET shape the app already uses, same resolved scope, only in the miss case); if that also misses, the `detail` names BOTH bounds and claims only absence-within-bounds. The fast path, `MachineRead` shape, `MAX_TOPIC_CHARS` truncation and the digest path are unchanged. Tests: a target seeded below the window is resolved through the fallback (fails against the pre-fix code), and a truly absent topic still reads `empty` with a window-truthful detail. Carriers synced to 6.114.13. |
| 6.114.12 | 2026-09-12 | **fix(memory): close the two duplicate-answer gaps the live pairs exposed — BG answer arbitration re-sourced and bounded, plus live/replay key parity in the web chat.** BG arbitration: the “in-flight owner turn” clause read `state/queue_snapshot.json`'s `running[].task.chat_id`, which witnessed NEITHER observed turn (22:32:43: the owner's turn ran 22:31:44 → 22:33:26 across the BG frame; 19:19:11: the same shape, pre-landing), so the predicate fail-opened and sent the frame anyway; clause (b) now reads the SAME chat tail clause (a) uses, via `_owner_turn_pending` — this chat's newest row is an owner (“in”) row younger than `BG_OWNER_TURN_PENDING_MAX_SECONDS = 900` — and the snapshot reader is deleted. The bound exists because an unanswered row is not proof of a live turn (error, cancel, closed tab): unbounded, the clause would mute the lane silently and forever, worse than the duplicate it fixes. Replaying the real tails against the applied code suppresses BOTH observed pairs (`owner_turn_pending` at each frame instant, `foreground_answer_recent` once the answers land). Web: `buildMessageKey` hashed differently on the live append (`chat.js:4138-4142` passes no `source`/`senderLabel`/`senderSessionId` — the WS frame cannot supply them) and on the replay rebuild (which passes them), so one durable row rendered twice until a reload; the key is normalized so both paths build it from the same inputs (the key function is the contract). Precedence and fail-open semantics are unchanged, and `CHAT_OUTBOUND`'s missing `sender_identity` stays a documented gap (no browser consumer: skill/extension/host-service subscribers only). Carriers synced to 6.114.12. |
| 6.114.11 | 2026-09-12 | **fix(memory): make the Engram seam honest end to end — scope guard, typed refusals, per-cycle emit budget, locatable cap disclosure.** Read side: a blank project scope is refused as a typed `config` fact instead of a bare 404 an operator reads as "no memory"; a single record the project-scoped `/timeline` cannot resolve retries ONCE with `all_projects=true`; `knowledge_list` discloses that the local index is the pre-switch archive; `rejected` now also covers a CLIENT-side refusal (unresolved scope), not only a store refusal. Write side: the per-run emit cap is now per CYCLE for the background loop and consolidation — it was a process-lifetime quota, so one boot burst starved every later write (observed live: `knowledge:infrastructure_gates` refused at 19:34, absent from the store); redundant verdict re-emissions are damped by a spool witness; a capped disclosure carries `run_emits`/`run_reset_at` so the refused record's run is locatable; `emit`'s except clause names `exc.__class__.__name__` (the `type` parameter shadowed the builtin). Plus: an F7 value-guard that flags `repo_dir=<drive root>` (it caught `consolidator.py:896`, declared and left to the owner), BG-answer arbitration (a duplicate reply to an already-answered owner message becomes an observation-inbox note instead of a second chat frame), the AC8(c) PATCH-leg test, and two comment/doc corrections (the Pattern Register is LOCAL — there is no `knowledge:patterns` mirror). Carriers synced to 6.114.11. |
| 6.114.10 | 2026-09-10 | **refactor(queue): extract scheduled-task CRUD into `supervisor/scheduled_tasks.py` (P7 module-size relief).** The six scheduled-task table functions (path/list/write/upsert/remove and the schedule→task builder) move out of `supervisor/queue.py` (1,638 → ~1,541 lines, under the 1,600-line GIANT gate); every historical name stays importable from `supervisor.queue` via re-exports (the `schedule_time.py` precedent), and cross-module calls resolve lazily at call time so the test monkeypatch surface and the process-wide queue lock survive unchanged. Also re-lands the `ouroboros/tools/delegate_integration.py:1206` git-quoted-symlink escape fix (double backslash — kills the recurring SyntaxWarning; the fix was lost in concurrent merge resolution and is recovered from the preserved branch tip). Carriers synced to 6.114.10. |
